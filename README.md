Jeddah landmarks and points of interest
=======================================

This is a map of interesting locations in and around Jeddah,
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. If you just want to look at the map,
see [here](https://maps.google.com/?q=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Virtakuono/.kml-repository/master/JeddahSaudiArabia.kml).

If you are interested in contributing and/or details, please read below:

Essentially, this is an effort to bring back to life
[this map](https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&t=h&hl=en&vps=1&jsv=178b&safe=on&oe=UTF8&msa=0&msid=109723124894778733708.0004726ebc11f578c532c&dg=feature)
that has been left unedited for almost three years at the time of writing.

In case you want to edit to make improvements or correct errors,
please fork and make pull request. Since the map essentially
relies on the github server to host the .kml file, note that
any changes need to be pushed to the server before they are
public. For debugging purposes you may
1. view your edited .kml file in, for example, google earth
2. put your kml file online somewhere and modify the gmail url accordingly
3. make changes while testing on a different branch than the master.

There are a plethora of google maps that have roughly the
same purpose as this map. Many of those maps appear to have
been copied from the same source and as they are
assumably not subject to copyright, 
geographical data has been copied from both of them rather
ruthlessly. 
Two maps especially worth mentioning are
(Jeddah: Interested Locations)[https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=203555040976874160945.0004cf9d6a73b19256e5f&msa=0&ll=20.694462,41.31958&spn=4.983057,8.448486&dg=feature]
and
(Jeddah Shopping)[https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&msa=0&msid=114277812997999651227.0004863c2f62b04789ee3&ll=21.487734,39.203382&spn=0.009803,0.021007&t=h&z=16&iwloc=000486d78d6a0da7a66b9&dg=feature] by Terry King.
The first one is a rather comprehensive list of items, but lacks
version control. Anyone can edit and as there is no version control,
any fat finger mistakes are nearly impossible to correct.
The latter one, on the other hand, is more correct, but the only
option to edit it is through emailing the author.
This map aims to fix the problems by
1. Creating a backup and version control of both of the maps mentioned above in order to track how these maps have been edited
2. Allowing non-git-users to make changes to the former map in a way that is easy to update into the relevant .kml file.

In addition to the two maps mentioned above, this repository
includes material from
(Claire Sale)[https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=216110785410091998621.0004a4de8ab547c2ca385&msa=0&ll=22.287002,39.112723&spn=0.001437,0.001851&dg=feature]
and professor Raul Tempone.
