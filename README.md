# Jeddah landmarks and points of interest

## Executive summary

This is a map of interesting locations in and around Jeddah,
mainly aimed to be used and edited by the KAUST community,
although anyone is warmly welcomed to have a sneak peek
and to contribute as well.

### Desktop users
Open 
<a href="https://rawgit.com/Virtakuono/.kml-repository/master/JeddahPOIs.htm" target="_blank">the map</a>
or a kml overlay on 
<a href="https://maps.google.com/?q=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Virtakuono/.kml-repository/master/JeddahSaudiArabia.kml" target="_blank">google maps</a>
in a browser and explore. To avoid extra clutter, there are small submaps of the following regions
<a href="https://maps.google.com/?q=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Virtakuono/.kml-repository/master/submap_Thuwal.kml" target="_blank">Thuwal</a>,
<a href="https://maps.google.com/?q=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Virtakuono/.kml-repository/master/submap_Jeddah.kml" target="_blank">Jeddah</a>,
<a href="https://maps.google.com/?q=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Virtakuono/.kml-repository/master/submap_Abha.kml" target="_blank">Abha</a> and
<a href="https://maps.google.com/?q=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Virtakuono/.kml-repository/master/submap_Taif.kml" target="_blank">Taif</a>.


### Smartphone, tablet, etc. users

Unfortunately, opening the map on a smartphone or a tablet can be a bit more subtle
and depends on which device and browser is being used and what apps have been installed.
So far only Apple/Windows devices have been tested.
If you are able (and you should be) to open the map on an android or
or blackberry or whatever gizmo, please tell us how you did it: juho.happola@iki.fi
For the time being, the Apple and WP instructions are the only ones available:

#### Apple iOS (iPhones and iPads and other iThings)

The essential data is stored in a .kml file that can be opened in two ways.
  1. In browser. This is probably the simplest way. Experience says that the best
     browser to view this map is using Safari. Open
     <a href="https://maps.google.com/?q=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Virtakuono/.kml-repository/master/JeddahSaudiArabia.kml" target="_blank">this map</a>
     in Safari and enjoy. If you open it in Google Chrome and you have Google Maps app installed,
     the browser will try to launch Google Maps App with devastating results.
  2. In an app such as Google Earth. This is the less simple way. First of all you have to have the app installed. Secondly
     you need to open 
     <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Virtakuono/.kml-repository/master/JeddahSaudiArabia.kml" target="_blank">this file</a>
     using that app. Unfortunately, if you click the link on a mobile device, you will likely have a bunch of code shown to you.
     The way around this is to download the file to a computer and to send it to yourself as an email attachment.
     Then, read your email using your mobile device and open the attachment. You should be offered a choice of apps to open it with,
     go for Google Earth.

#### Windows phone

  1. Open 
     <a href ="https://maps.google.com/?q=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Virtakuono/.kml-repository/master/JeddahSaudiArabia.kml" target="_blank">this link</a>
     to view the map.
  2. You may also download the
     <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Virtakuono/.kml-repository/master/JeddahPOIs.lmx" target="_blank">coordinates in Nokia lmx format </a>
     (In testing).

## Longer readme

### What is this?

Essentially, this is an effort to bring back to life
<a href="https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&t=h&hl=en&vps=1&jsv=178b&safe=on&oe=UTF8&msa=0&msid=109723124894778733708.0004726ebc11f578c532c&dg=feature" target="_blank">this map</a>
that has been left unedited for almost three years at the time of writing.
Later on other maps and other people have contributed to the contents
of this map overlay file and associated database. The goals are

  1. To provide geographical information in an usable form.
  2. To generate a revision history of the map while allowing
     the general audience to contribute to the contents.
  3. Maintain the geographical data in a format where
     pretty much anyone has access to the coordinate numbers
     in case the data needs to be transferred somewhere.

### How to contribute?

There are a few ways you can do to contribute:

1. Add a new point of interest: go to
   <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-34A8wdzOaiz36Mnx74PbDsaRGTcCZP92rPLV9aP3fM/edit#gid=0" target="_blank">
   the google spreadsheet
   </a>, copy a row of data and make a duplicate of it.
   You will need to know the coordinates of the point you are adding.
   To this end, you can use
   <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/coordinates-calculate-convert/id494286614?mt=8" target="_blank">
   coordinates app
   </a>,
   locate the coordinates on
   <a href="https://rawgit.com/Virtakuono/.kml-repository/master/coordfinder.htm" target="_blank">this map</a>,
   or use some other method that suits you.
2. If you have a photo taken on a camera phone at a location you would like to add,
   send it to juho.happola@iki.fi, please send the photo with the poorest quality settings,
   all that is needed is the coordinates that most smartphones record into the photo automatically.
   Include a description of the location and other information as you deem fit. Also notify
   if you do not want to be credited for your contribution.

#### Do remember

The data will not be automatically transferred to the map,
this is known feature to avoid erroneous edits.
To speed up the editorial process send an email to juho.happola@iki.fi. 

When editing the map please avoid the following common mistakes
  1. Assuming everyone knows you. In compiling this map I have had to do some forensics, maps like this tend to be
     copied from one source to another and statements like "This is the best yemeni restaurant I have been to" lose
     meaning when nobody knows who "I" is. Please consider leaving an identifying notification, initials, email address or
     a nickname.
  2. Spelling. Nothing gets transferred to the master map without a brief review. Please make this review a bit easier by
     avoiding excessive capitalisation, broken engrish and the like.
  3. Removing Points of Interest: Removing old and outdated info is as important (if not more important) as adding new ones.
     When one removes a line from the spreadsheet, it is often hard to distinguish whether this was
     an erroneous edit, vandalism or something that should be published. Thus, if you feel that there
     is a POI that should not be there, please go to the spreadsheet
     and write into the description section of the relevant POI something like:
     "This shop has been closed since May 2013" or "I was there, I did not see a camel souq",
     if possible, along with your initials, contact information or a nickname. Alternatively,
     send an email to complain.
  4. Coordinate systems. 
     If you have coordinates in degrees, minutes and seconds, please go to 
     the coordinate transformation tab on the spreadsheet and enter the
     archaic coordinates to transform them into more modern ones.

Should you want to contribute code, icons, or add new types of
points of interest, I recommend you fork the repository, do your changes
and make a pull request.

### Credits, acknowledgements

There are a plethora of google maps that have roughly the
same purpose as this map and credit to most of the contents in
this map belongs to the people who have initiated and maintained
those maps.
Many of those maps appear to have
been copied from the same source. The material
has been screened as well as possible and the relevant bits
included in the new map.
Two maps especially worth mentioning are
[Jeddah: Interested Locations](https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=203555040976874160945.0004cf9d6a73b19256e5f&msa=0&ll=20.694462,41.31958&spn=4.983057,8.448486&dg=feature)
and
[Jeddah Shopping](https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&msa=0&msid=114277812997999651227.0004863c2f62b04789ee3&ll=21.487734,39.203382&spn=0.009803,0.021007&t=h&z=16&iwloc=000486d78d6a0da7a66b9&dg=feature) by Terry King.
The first one is a rather comprehensive list of items, but lacks
version control. Anyone can edit and as there is no version control,
any fat finger mistakes are nearly impossible to correct.
The latter one, on the other hand, is more correct, but the only
option to edit it is through emailing the author.
This map aims to fix the problems by
  1. Creating a backup and version control of both of the maps mentioned above in order to track how these maps have been edited
  2. Allowing non-git-users to make changes to the former map in a way that is easy to update into the relevant .kml file.

In addition to the two maps mentioned above, this repository
includes material from
[Claire Sale](https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=216110785410091998621.0004a4de8ab547c2ca385&msa=0&ll=22.287002,39.112723&spn=0.001437,0.001851&dg=feature),
Greg Wickham, Aya Rae, Grace Gruendler and professor Raul Tempone.
Thank you for helpful comments and corrections from Idris Aija, and Luca Passone.
