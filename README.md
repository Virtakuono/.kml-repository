Essentially, this is an effort to bring back to life the map

Another noteworthy source of information is 
[http://goo.gl/maps/mFxL3]
from where a lot of icons have been copied more or less
verbatim leaving out a few obviously misplaced icons, such
as Danube market at the Beach, and La Plage beach in the sea.
A problem with this map is that - to my knowledge -
it has no version control and any mistakes committed by mistake
are hard to correct. This repository includes a small script that
a) Downloads a backup of the relevant .kml file for version control
b) Allows to track the changes that non-git-users make to that map
